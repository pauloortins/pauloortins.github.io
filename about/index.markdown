## About me

Hi guys, I’m Paulo Ortins, I’m 24 years old and I’m very passionate about coding.

I started to programming in 2008, when I began the college. At this time, I was learning Pascal. After that I became a addicted to programming language , and I started to learn all the languages that appeared in front of me, Javascript, Java, Ruby, Scala, Python and my first language, C#, that I’m working with since 2010.

If you read my blog, you will also see that I’m an automated tests advocate, it’s a way to achieve clean and error’s free code, and leave me free to do what I love, improve my code and do refactoring!

In 2011, I decided that, I wanted to be part of the software community and I started to blog, attend to user meetings and events and I created some developer groups:

[#horaextra](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=pt-BR&fromgroups#!forum/horaextra-bahia) – Weekly meeting where we talk about programming, agile, science and so on.<br>
[DotNetSalvador](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=pt-BR&fromgroups#!forum/dotnet-salvador) – .NET developer’s group from Salvador -Bahia.
