## About me

I have been developing software professionally since 2010 in every side of software development (Web, Mobile and Desktop), during this time I used several technologies like C#, ASP.NET (MVC and WebApi), EntityFramework, Selenium, Xamarin.Droid, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Forms and Java for Android and another number of techniques and methodologies like Xtreme Programming, Scrum, TDD, BDD and DDD.

Nowadays, I see myself more as a solution provider than a software developer, since, what really matters is not how many different technologies I know and yes how I can use them to create more and more value for my customers with the goal to maximize their investiment.

I also advocate that knowledge should be shared to be multiplied and in the last years I have been speaking about software development in small, medium and big conferences around Brazil. For those that can't watch a talk in Brazil I also write about C# and Xamarin in this blog.
