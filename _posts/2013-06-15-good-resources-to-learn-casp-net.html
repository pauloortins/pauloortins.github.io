<p>A friend is starting to use C# and asked me to recommend some resources. I had the idea to make a resource list:</p>
<p><strong>Books:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430242337/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1430242337&linkCode=as2&tag=paulorti-20">Pro C# 5.0 and the .NET 4.5 Framework</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=paulorti-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1430242337" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Andrew Troelsen: Has been considered by readers, the best book to learn C#, there are a lot of good reviews on amazon. It covers from basics about c# until advanced areas like delegates, lambda expressions, reflections and so on.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1935182471/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1935182471&linkCode=as2&tag=paulorti-20">C# in Depth, Second Edition</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=paulorti-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1935182471" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by John Skeet: My favorite C# book, it covers the improvements made in the language since C#1/2. It explains what were the motivations behind each new feature. It's a good book to know more about C# history.</p>

After that, it ends up building a web application from the scratch using TDD and ASP.NET MVC.</p>
