<p>A couple weeks ago I was in a walk with a friend of mine, he was complaining about the speed of changes in the software development world. In his words, every week something new appears, it can be a new methodology, a new framework, a new programming language and so on, and we, developers, we need to make choices for each one. </p>
<p>Is it worth my time? Is it promising or not ? </p>
<p>And even after we made these choices, every year we have to make them again, maybe a hot technology became obsolete or a technology that didn't appear to be promising is now the hottest in our local market and we need to learn it as soon as possible. </p>
<p>My answer to him was that software development world is like a stock market. Let me explain my analogy.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Software Development, a stock market</h2>
<p><br/><br />

<br/></p>
<p>For me, the software development characteristics that my friend was complaining about is very similar to a stock market, as in software development new companies are appearing every day (technologies) and investors (developers) need to choose which they will put their money (time). There is only one uncomfortable difference for us, while an investor can choose a large number of companies to put their money, we, developers, difficultly can really learn more than 2 or 3 new things concurrently, it puts a lot of pressure on our shoulders, since 2 or 3 bad decisions in a row can put us in a bad position in the market.</p>
<p>But accordingly my analogy, how a young investor should choose their stocks in the software market?</p>

<h2>Choosing stocks</h2>

<p>There are three ways that people win money in a stock market, or they invest in the true value of a company, that is called Fundamental analysis, and it's used by maybe the greatest all-time investor, Warren Buffet, or people speculate about the stock values, trying to buy them when they appear to be cheap and selling them when they're expensive. There is also the small caps, companies who have a low market capitalization and due it are more riskier. In software market we can't speculate since we don't buy and sell technologies, once we learn something, we can't forget it, all we can do is to avoid to invest more time. So, our young investor has two options, the fundamental analysis and the small caps to invest their money (time).</p>
<p>As a young developer, what's the best? Bet in a new technology or choose a well-established and already profitable technology?</p>

<h2>Time Travel</h2>
<p><disclaimer><em>Disclaimer: The languages used below are only examples to explain the whole idea, I don't want to provoke any flame war.</em></disclaimer></p>
<p>Coming back to 2005, Rails is rising, Ruby is as older as Java but with very fewer developers, Java and .NET are already stablished languages. What would have happened if our young developer had chosen Ruby to start his career? And if he had chosen Java or .NET?</p>
<p>Assuming that he had put all his efforts on the chosen language, as a Ruby developer with 8 years of experience, he would be one of the most experienced ruby developers in the world, maybe he could be also a world class speaker and his position would be very comfortable, a lot of startups would be hunting him, after all, he would be so rare!</p>
<p>As a .NET developer or a Java developer with 8 years of experience, he probably would have a good job, but he wouldn't be one of the most experienced developers in the world, after all, there are developers using Java for 15 years, these will be the best choice when a company needs a true specialist.</p>
<p>We can use the same comparison with other periods, for example, the rising of iOS and Android, the rising of Big Data and Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Node, Clojure, Scala and so on. Of course, some of these bets can be or could be bad choices, as happened, in my opinion, with VB.NET, Windows Mobile, JME and Silverlight, but for a small cap investor it's part of the game.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>My opinion</h2>
<p>IMHO, I would advice our young developer to bet in new technologies/methodologies, it represents a big chance that if the chosen technology achieve a good market share, he will be a world class specialist, otherwise, he will be pursuing the same path already taken by other developers, but the other developers will always be more experienced. </p>
<p>Of course, we know that experience in one technology helps a developer to learn another one, but, for a big data job, I would still hire a developer with 8 years of experience in Big data rather than another that was a web developer for 6 years and 2 years ago started to develop big data solutions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>And you?</h2>
<p>And you? </p>
<p>Which advice you would give to a young developer?<br />
Do you prefer to be an early adopter or you wait until it's mature enough?<br />
Do you have some experience about your choices to share with us?</p>
