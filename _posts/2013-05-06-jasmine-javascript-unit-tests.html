<p>Some time ago I wrote about how important is to write unit tests for our code, you can read it <a href="/2012/09/25/tdd-test-driven-development/" title="Intro to TDD â€“ Test-Driven Development">here</a>.</p>
<p>Today, I have seen a lot of developers talking about unit tests, but the majority of these efforts are focused to backend. My team is a example, we have a good coverage on our backend code but we leave the javascript code to be tested by the browser tests. Is it wrong ?</p>
<p>IMO, YES ! First of all, browser tests are slow, and they don't fail beautiful, we have less fail information in a acceptance tests than we would have in a unit test, and second, javascript is the language of the moment, jQuery, became interactive applications creation easier, and a lot of javascript frameworks have been created in the recent years, e.g. <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">backbone.js</a>, <a href="http://angularjs.org/">angular.js</a>, <a href="http://emberjs.com/">ember.js</a> and so on. It's not a surprise that javascript is the most used language in <a href="https://www.loggly.com/blog/the-most-popular-programming-languages-in-to-github-since-2012/">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>With these informations, I googled for some unit test frameworks for javascript. The most used are:</p>
<p><a href="http://qunitjs.com/">QUnit</a>, framework created in 2009 by the jQuery Team.<br />
<a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/">Mocha</a>, bdd framework integrated with node.js.<br />
<a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/">Jasmine</a>, as Mocha, is a bdd framework and we will use this one in this post.</p>
<h1><strong>Jasmine</strong></h1>
<p>Jasmine was created due the dissatisfaction from the creators with existing framworks, between these dissatisfactions are the fact what most of them don't support async tests and others have a ugly syntax, hard to understand. Jasmine was born with the following ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>RSpec based, from Ruby</li>
<li>Should encourage good tests practice</li>
<li>Easily integrated with build systems</li>
<li>And of course, easy to use</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Jasmine works</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe</em></p>
<p>A Jasmine test suite starts with a <em>describe</em> declaration that is a function that receive two parameters, the test suite name, and another function that will implement the tests.</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
describe("My test suite", function() {});
{% endhighlight %}
<p><br/><br />
<em>It</em></p>
<p>The tests are implemented by the <em>It</em> function, that as <em>describe</em>, receive two parameters, the test name, and the function that represents the test.</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
describe("My test suite", function() {
  
  it("testing a positive case", function() {
  });

  it("testing a negative case", function() {
  });

});
{% endhighlight %}
<p><br/><br />
<em>Expect/Matchers</em></p>
<p>The <em>expects</em> in jasmine are made by the <em>matchers</em>, that will compare the actual value with the expected value. The matchers can execute a negative assert using the <em>not</em> operator.</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
describe("My test suite", function() {
  
  it("testing a positive case", function() {
     expect(true).toBe(true);
  });
  
  it("testing a negative case", function() {
     expect(true).not.toBe(false);
  });

});
{% endhighlight %}
<p><br/></p>
<p>The Jasmine by default has a lot of <em>matchers</em>, but it's extensible, new <em>matchers</em> can be added to <em>framework</em>.</p>
{% highlight javascript %}

beforeEach(function() {
  this.addMatchers({
    shouldBeLessThan: function(expected) {
      return this.actual < expected;
    }
  });
});

{% endhighlight %}
<p><br/><br />
<em>Setup/Teardown</em></p>
<p>Jasmine has support to <em>Setup</em> (functions that will be executed <strong>before</strong> each test) and to the <em>Teardown</em> (functions that will be executed <strong>after</strong> each test).</p>
{% highlight javascript %}

describe("My test suite", function() {
  var foo;

  beforeEach(function() {
     // Function that will be executed BEFORE each test
  });

  afterEach(function() {
     // Function that will be executed AFTER each test
  });

});

{% endhighlight %}
<p><br/><br />
<em>Spies</em></p>
<p>Jasmine has support to <em>Mocks</em> using <em>Spies</em>, and also provide some custom matchers to make asserts using spies.</p>
<p><em>toHaveBeenCalled</em>, will return true if the spy was called</p>
{% highlight javascript %}

describe("My suite test", function() {
  var student, grade;

  beforeEach(function() {
    student = {
      setGrade: function(value) {
        grade = value;
      }
    };

    spyOn(student, 'setGrade');

    student.setGrade(9);
  });

  it("verify if setGrade was called", function() {
    expect(student.setGrade).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});

{% endhighlight %}
<p><br/><br />
<em>andReturn</em>, will mock a object, and all calls will return the same value</p>
{% highlight javascript %}

describe("A spy, when faking a return value", function() {
  var student, grade;

  beforeEach(function() {
    student = {
      setGrade: function(value) {
        grade = value;
      },
      getGrade: function() {
        return grade;
      }
    };

    spyOn(student, 'getGrade').andReturn(8);
  });

  it("verify if it is the mocked grade", function() {
    expect(student.getGrade()).toEqual(8);
  });
});

{% endhighlight %}

In the next post, I will show how to use <strong>Jasmine</strong> in practice, creating a <em>Code Kata</em> using BDD and Jasmine :)</p>
